Bernura Cuttlefish Fontby Jason Pagura ©2001Bernur is the first font I completed, originally in 1996 with the name Pagura Gothic. I’ve recently adjusted the spacing and added the Euro mark, so I finally feel comfortable releasing it.Bernur is freeware, which means you don't have to pay for it. You may use it wherever you want, and make copies of it for your friends. You may not, however, claim the font as your own design, or redistribute it for any charge. If you do distribute this font, this Read Me file must accompany the font file.In using my fonts, you agree to hold me harmless should any damage occour to your computer or other assetts. There shouldn’t be anything here to cause a problem, but weirder things have happened.While you don't have to pay for Bernur, you are welcome to send whatever you feel is appropriate in appreciation of my work. Picture postcards of your home town, beef jerkey, demo tapes, and nude pictures of yourself or significant other are all acceptable forms of appreciation, but I'll take cash too, or whatever you can imagine. Nothing that would violate postal regulations. If you use Bernur or any of my other fonts for commercial purposes, please send me a sample of the result.In case you should happen to need any illustration, graphic design, or custom font design, please think of employing my services.This font and others of my design can be found on my website:http://cuttlefish.8m.com/Send your comments and gifts towassergott@yahoo.comorJason Pagura10581 Stokes Ave.Cupertino, CA 95014-1239
